# Running tests

As we are using generated routes we used the `drf_test_generator` package to bootstrap our tests then adapted them to meet the api criterias.

The tests are located in the **CodeLeapApp** folder in the `tests.py` file.

The tests verifies all the Key Concepts above, including username that cannot be changed and all CRUD logic.

You can run the tests with the command above:

```
python manage.py test
```

# Key concepts

- The project itself is built using Django and DNF
- **id**, **username**, **created_datetime** cannot be changed on update (for reference in how username is skipped from the update process please refer to the views.py file)
- For best performance we are using paginated results, **10 results per page** (for reference on pagination details, please refer to the settings.py file)
- Delete should not return any data
- built using a virtual environment
- Api tests we're done using **Postman**
